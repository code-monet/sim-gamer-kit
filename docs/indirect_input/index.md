# IndirectInput

`IndirectInput` is a DLL-replacement fixer for game-controller compatibility
issues seen with DirectInput devices that *cannot* be fixed in some other way.
This is because:

> DLL-replacement fixes are usually detected by anti-cheat software, and
depending on the game, may cause a soft ban. Do not use `IndirectInput` fixes
for such games, instead, pester the developer to fix the problem.

TODO: Fill out this section once `IndirectInput` is launched.
