# FFFSake

> Through this document, FFB is used as an acronym for Force Feedback.

`FFFSake`, or **F**or **F**orce **F**eedback's **Sake**, is:

*   Technically, a
library that can bridge FFB commands received by vJoy to a
DirectInput-compatible device.
*   Practically, a plugin to get FFB effects on your
physical device while your game is actually being played with a
vJoy virtual joystick, which is in turn being fed with inputs by an
application like Joystick Gremlin.

# What is this for?

> tl;dr if you're having a wheel/joystick binding, input, or FFB
problem, [Joystick Gremlin](https://whitemagic.github.io/JoystickGremlin)
with `FFFSake` can usually help you work around that.

In a perfect world, your game controller (typically a racing wheel or
joystick/HOTAS, plus additional hardware like pedals, H-shifter etc.)
would allow configuring **inputs** in ways that work for everyone. They would
also correctly implement **outputs** i.e., the
[FFB
specification for DirectInput devices](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/desktop/ee417563(v=vs.85))
**completely** and **correctly**, so that the player gets the game developers'
intended experience.

Meanwhile, the game you're playing would have a nice configurable control
scheme. It would allow you to tune your FFB experience based on
your preferences and your specific hardware.

In the real world, both hardware and software can fall short or fail at these
for a variety of reasons. This is where third-party tools like Joystick Gremlin
and vJoy come in. You configure your game to use the vJoy virtual joystick as a FFB
capable input device, and use [Joystick Gremlin](https://whitemagic.github.io/JoystickGremlin)
to read control inputs from
various sources (say, your physical steering wheel), and "feed" them into the
vJoy virtual joystick. This allows you to fix a broad range of input-related
issues, such as:

1.  Setting response curves for analog axes, usually pedals.
2.  Configuring buttons and switches as toggle or sticky.
3.  Converting split pedals to combined or vice versa (for using modern racing pedals with flight sims or older racing games)
4.  Macro playback
5.  Combination inputs
6.  Mode switches

`FFFSake` handles the output i.e. FFB side of things, taking these commands
from the vJoy device (coming from the game) and writing them to your physical
FFB capable device. In this process, it can also fix various force
feedback issues and allow some amount of tweaking; see the Features section later.

## Why Joystick Gremlin?

While there are other applications with similar functionality, feeding vJoy with
inputs from DirectInput devices, none of them appear to be maintained by the time of
this writing.
[Joystick Gremlin](https://whitemagic.github.io/JoystickGremlin) is actively being
developed; we will be using the older but stable R13 version.

Support could be added for other vJoy feeders, especially if someone is willing to
help integrate `FFFSake` as a DLL or Python module into the feeder. Please get in touch
via
[GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/code-monet/sim-gamer-kit/discussions).

## Setup

Budget about 15-45 minutes for [the one-time setup](setup.md).

## Usage

Once you've completed the above one-time setup, future usage involves
(do all these **BEFORE** starting your game):

1.  Launching HidHide and ensuring the filter is enabled.
2.  Launch Joystick Gremlin and load your desired profile.
3.  Optional: Set gain percentages for hardware force feedback effects. Games typically
    use a subset of these, so changing them may not have an effect. The
    [game guides](../game_guides/index.md)
    have recommended settings for some games. The default value is 50%. See the
    [game issues guide](../game_guides/issues.md) for why you might want to change these.
4.  Click on `Activate`. `FFFSake` will activate if it's a plugin loaded for this profile.
    1.  With the profile active, you can use the button you bound earlier to toggle muting.
    `FFFSake`. `Tools` > `Log Display` > `User` will show a message when `FFFSake` is
    turned on or off.

At this point you can launch your game and configure it for vJoy. You should be
able to select and configure it inside the game as you would a physical controller.

### FFFSake Features

`FFFSake` has two "engines" that connect the FFB commands received by the vJoy
device to your physical FFB-capable controller. They do this in rather different
ways, as described below.

#### Forwarder Engine

The `forwarder` engine takes FFB commands received from vJoy (coming from
the game or from Windows) and writes them to the physical device using DirectInput.
In this process, the common compatibility fixes, described later, are also applied.
This engine has relatively lower CPU usage but cannot fix all compatibility issues.

#### Reducer Engine

The `reducer` engine takes FFB commands received from vJoy (coming from
the game or from Windows) and "reduces" them to a stream of constant forces, which
are written to the physical device using DirectInput. This way the above common and
following additional compatibility issues can be fixed:

1.  Incorrect [hardware effects](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/desktop/ee417541(v=vs.85))
    in the physical device. See also
    [types of FFB issues](../game_guides/issues.md).
2.  More accurate "slip" if the application command rate exceeds what the device can
    handle.

#### Common Features

Both engines have the following features:

1.  Fix incorrect rotation of effects on racing wheels (but see also:
    [Indirect Input](../indirect_input/index.md))
2.  "Slip" FFB commands when they are issued faster than the device can handle them,
    usually leading to a drop in FPS in game when using a FFB device.
3.  Setting gain for individual hardware effects (requires re-`Activate` in Gremlin).

## Limitations and Known Issues

The following limitations exist because I don't know of any gamers who are affected by
them; if you are, please in touch via
[GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/code-monet/sim-gamer-kit/discussions)

1.  Only one vJoy device is currently supported.
2.  Only single FFB axis devices are supported in the `reducer` engine. In other
    words, it's only expected to be used for racing wheels. I don't know of any
    FFB joysticks that have mistakes in their hardware effects implementation.

The following known issues and planned features will be addressed
in a future release:

1.  Decrease CPU usage, especially for the `reducer` engine.
2.  Only single FFB axis devices are supported in the `forwarder` engine. In other
    words, it's only expected to be used for racing wheels. It's relatively easy to
    add support for (two axes) FFB joysticks, it's just currently lower
    priority given how rare such devices are.
3.  Some effects (friction and inertia, mainly) in the `reducer` engine could be refined.
    These effects are not commonly used.
4.  Ability to adjust gains of hardware effects via the Gremlin plugins UI for both
    engines.
5.  The `FFFSake` pluging may need to be removed and re-added to a profile if you
    change your FFB device.

## Troubleshooting

### General

The plugin publishes some messages via the Joystick Gremlin logging system, which you can
view in the latter by going to `Tools` > `Log Display` > `User`.

`FFFSake` generates an error log file in the directory where Joystick Gremlin is running
from. If you run into an issue and the file contains errors or warnings, please open a
GitHub issue attaching the log file.

If force feedback cuts out or you seem to suddenly be missing effects, try Alt-tabbing out
of the game and then getting back into it, this should generally fix the problem. Please
check the `FFFSake` log for errors and send feedback via GitHub.

### ImportError: DLL Load failed: The specified procedure could not be found

See the `Setup` section above, and follow the steps to replace the `vJoyInterface.dll` packaged
with Joystick Gremlin with the latest one you downloaded from GitHub earlier.
