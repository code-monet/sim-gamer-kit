# Common Compatibility Issues

This document describes input or force feedback compatibility issues
seen with DirectInput (some gamepads, and most joysticks, HOTAS sets, and
racing wheels) devices and games.

> Controllers with "rumble" or "vibration" as opposed to force feedback are
usually Xinput devices and not DirectInput. This document does not apply to
them.

## Game Loop Blocked By Force Feedback Commands

The typical way this issue manifests is, loss of frame rate only when
using FFB devices (wheels). Another possible way this could manifest is,
laggy force feedback, but there are no reports of this yet. This happens
because the game loop is slowed down or thrown out of sync by DirectInput
FFB commands blocking for longer than the application expects.

> When the game is not in focus, this issue will go away, but this might
be difficult to observe unless you're using windowed or borderless mode in
the game. MSI Afterburner's FPS-vs-time graph can also be used to catch this
behavior.

### Fixes

1.  It is possible for such delays to come from USB hubs - try connecting
    the device directly to a USB port on the motherboard. Try different
    ports as well. USB 2 vs 3 shouldn't matter much, but worth trying anyway.
2.  It is possible for such delays to happen because of a slow/throttling CPU.
    Try closing non-essential applications. Also check that your CPU is
    performing as expected.
3.  Sometimes this is unavoidable with the physical device you are using;
    you will need to use [FFFSake](../fffsake/index.md).

## Zeroed Pedals

Technically speaking, analog axes have a resting position and an associated value
that the application sees. For "legacy controllers", analog axes would give a value
of 0 in their resting position - a zeroed axis. Contemporary devices have largely
ditched this convention for axes that are resting at an end of their travel range
rather than the center. Instead they typically give a large positive or negative
reading, which can throw off games not expecting this.

Practically speaking, for modern:

*   Wheels:
    *   The wheel axis is zeroed
    *   The pedals are **not** zeroed
    *   Analog pedals are **not** zeroed
*   Flight controllers:
    *   Joystick axes are zeroed
    *   Throttles are zeroed, but usually unsprung so this doesn't really apply.
    *   Yaw pedals are zeroed
    *   Toe brake pedals are (probably, need to confirm) **not** zeroed

If you use such a device with a game that expects zeroed axes, then in the game
control binding menu, you'll see one or more of:

*   Some random axis (quickly) gets bound when you try to rebind a control
*   Some games use the wheel and pedal controls to navigate menus. You might
    find the menus navigating themselves.

If you manage to bind controls and then play the game, you'll probably see
the following in game:

*   Accelerator and brake are ineffective or applied together (usually causing
    unintended burnout and donuts).
*   Camera may be pointing the wrong way (left or right or behind).

### Fixes

This issue is usually only seen with wheel *pedals* and analog *paddles*
(not shifter paddles, those are technically buttons).

1.  The hardware manufacturer device control panel or app may an option to
    "combine pedals", try that.
2.  That option may not be available, or worse
    than having separate zeroed pedals (some games require zeroed pedals but
    allow separate pedals to be bound and used to e.g. do a burnout). In this
    case use Joystick Gremlin to zero the pedals.

## Combined Pedals

In addition to pedals being zeroed (see above section), they sometimes also need
to be combined. Usually this presents as: the game only lets you bind a single axis
for both accelerator and brake. You will also typically run into this issue if you
try to use modern racing pedals for yaw control in a flight game.

### Fixes

Same as for zeroed pedals, except if using Joystick Gremlin, use
"combined pedals" from the `Actions` menu.

## Hardware Effects Usage

HID PID devices are supposed to implement a number of hardware effects, which
games can use via the
[DirectInput API](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/desktop/ee417541(v=vs.85)). The simplest of these is the Constant effect, which can be used to
emulate all other effects. Game developers with advanced physics tend to go
this way, especially more recent games that expect more powerful CPUs. Games
with simpler physics engines, or games designed for older CPUs instead prefer to
use hardware effects.

A number of compatibility issues arise from usage of hardware effects because:

1.  Of bugs in DirectInput, which is a deprecated API not seeing further
    bug fixes.
2.  Incorrect usage of the DirectInput APIs by games, game engines, or
    input libraries wrapping DirectInput (Logitech's SDK, SDL, ...?).
3.  Incorrect interpretation of the complex PID protocol by hardware makers.
4.  With contemporary games mostly moving to using the `Constant` effect only
    (and sometimes `Damper`), hardware makers have unfortunately started
    neglecting the other built-in effects, implementing them partially or
    incorrectly.

Of the above, 1 and 2 are addressed in the next section, while 3 and 4 belong
to this section. They can be difficult for the typical gamer to discover, but
some signs are:

1.  Seemingly nonsensical force feedback effects mismatched with in-game events.
2.  Extremely weak effects
3.  Missing effects

Again, for most of these, a typical gamer wouldn't know what to expect and
therefore wouldn't know if something is wrong.

### Fixes

Try using the `Reducer` engine from `FFFSake` and play the game for a bit. Compare
your experience with the `Forwarding` engine. If the former is giving a better
experience, you are running into this issue! Please report the game and wheel via
[GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/code-monet/sim-gamer-kit/discussions)!

Things to look out for (in driving games; I only have a FFB wheel), even in more
"arcady" games:

1.  Driving over rough terrain should cause rumble.
2.  Crashing into objects should cause a sharp kick.
3.  Steering resistance should apply, usually stronger at higher speeds and may or
    may not be abset when stopped.
    1.  It should always be counter to the direction you're steering, and it should
        apply in both directions.
4.  Drifting should be felt, usually as a loss/reduction in steering resistance.

If the `Forwarding` engine is giving a better experience, this is unexpected unless
your CPU is quite slow/starved/throttled. Please report these as well (unless
your CPU is quite slow/starved/throttled).

## Other DirectInput (Usage) Bugs

Causes 1 and 2 above lead to very wide variety of obscure bugs. Thankfully these are
relatively rare, and tend to be game or developer specific. Some examples are:

1.  Game crash only when using an FFB wheel - the only obvious one on this list.
2.  Loss of some or all effects in games that do have FFB
3.  Game effects feeling _wrong_ (vague, I know).
4.  Certain features disabled in the game for your controller e.g. FFB settings
    (Dirt Rally, Crew 2), H-shifter (Dirt 3, Dirt Rally) but known to be supported
    for others.

1 and 2 can be fixed simply by using `FFFSake`. 3 might be fixed by `FFFSake`
using the `Reducer` engine, or might need `IndirectInput`. 4 will typically need
`IndirectInput`.

## Inverted Force Feedback

In some games, force feedback can apply in the wrong direction. The wheel will usually
be hard to control in these cases, and you'll notice that steering resistance is
actually in the opposite direction. The wheel might oscillate wildly.

### Fixes

This *could* be fixed using `FFFSake`, but this is not currently implemented as I have
not seen a game that needs this. When I have heard of this happening, the developer is
on the hook for fixing it and usually follows through.
