## Tools

### FFFSake, force feedback engine for vJoy

FFFSake, or **F**or **F**orce **F**eedback's **Sake**, is:

*   Technically, a
library that can bridge force feedback commands received by vJoy to a
DirectInput compatible device.
*   Practically, a plugin to get force feedback effects on your
physical device while your game is actually being played with a
vJoy virtual joystick, which is in turn being fed with inputs by an
application like Joystick Gremlin.

### IndirectInput, compatibility fixes for DirectInput games and devices

IndirectInput is a DLL-replacement based video game compatibility fixer,
focused on fixing issues seen when playing flight and racing games with
DirectInput devices.

### Joystick as H-shifter

A Joystick Gremlin plugin to use 2 analog axes (typically a flight stick)
as an H-shifter.

### Joystick as Handbrake

A Joystick Gremlin plugin to use an analog axis (typically a flight
throttle) as a handbrake (in games that only support toggle
handbrakes).
